# Cornerman
Public Repository for the Cornerman Site and API.

My Cornerman repository, site and API is primarily to achieve the following goals:

1. Demonstrate to prospective employers of my skills and abilities as an Microsoft architect/developer
2. Upskill to AngularJS, which is something I have wanted to do for years
3. Develope a useful solution for my Motorcycle Club for their outings

The repository is public and can, should they feel the need, be used by anyone.
I have included code, issues and some wiki pages.
